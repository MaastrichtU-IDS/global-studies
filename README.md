 



# Global Studies Method Track Website

This website contains a collection of  tutorials, developed at the University of Maastricht for our students in Global Studies that use python. 

The goal is to organize relevant material into modular components, for more efficient design and maintenance of material, that can be used across semesters, and that are accessible to students during and after their studies.

 
# Global Studies Method Track Website

This website contains a collection of  tutorials, developed at the University of Maastricht for our students in Global Studies that use python. 

The goal is to organize relevant material for quantiative methods in a efficient manner, that can be findable and accessible and reusable to students during and after their studies, and can be used across semesters.

## Tutorial 1
Today is an introduction to statistics and coding in Python for our students in Global Studies. This tutorial references JupyterLab, but can be taught using a regular Python interpreter as well as Google Colab. Please note that this tutorial uses Python 3.

### Jupyter Notebooks
Today we will focus on the following:
+ [Variables and basic operations](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/MaastrichtU-IDS/global-studies/blob/main/semester2/notebooks/1.1-variables-and-assig.ipynb) - ✔️ [Solutions](https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/global-studies/blob/main/semester2/notebooks/1.1-variables-and-assig-solutions.ipynb)
+ [Data Types](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/MaastrichtU-IDS/global-studies/blob/main/semester2/notebooks/1.2-data-types.ipynb) - ✔️ [Solutions](https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/global-studies/blob/main/semester2/notebooks/1.2-data-types-solutions.ipynb)
+ [Built-in functions and libraries](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/MaastrichtU-IDS/global-studies/blob/main/semester2/notebooks/1.3-built-in-functions-and-libraries.ipynb) - ✔️ [Solutions](https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/global-studies/blob/main/semester2/notebooks/1.3-built-in-functions-and-libraries-solutions.ipynb)
+ [For Loops and List](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/MaastrichtU-IDS/global-studies/blob/main/semester2/notebooks/1.4-for-loops.ipynb) - ✔️ [Solutions](https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/global-studies/blob/main/semester2/notebooks/1.4-for-loops-solutions.ipynb)
+ [Customized functions](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/MaastrichtU-IDS/global-studies/blob/main/semester2/notebooks/1.5-writing-functions.ipynb) - ✔️ [Solutions](https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/global-studies/blob/main/semester2/notebooks/1.5-writing-functions-solutions.ipynb)
